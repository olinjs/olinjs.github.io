      "bio": "Josh Langowitz is an Electrical and Computer Engineer in the Olin College class of 2016 from Wellesley, Massachusetts. He enjoys casually deflecting serious questions with humour, food, and moonlit drives along Rainbow Road. His first exposure to javascript was as a student in the 2013 iteration of Olin.js, which set him on his path as a programmer. He has since interned for Athenahealth as a software developer and will be working for Tableau Software as a test developer in the summer of 2015. His Bacon number is 3 after an uncredited appearance in Top Chef, and he is currently pursuing undergraduate research in graph theory, partly in his quest for an Erdos-Bacon number, but mostly because it’s actually very interesting.",
      "realbio": "Josh Langowitz may be small, but don’t be fooled by his diminutive stature; this pipsqueak spent the last five years dominating the underground Lucha Libre circuit in and around Guadalajara Mexico. A small misunderstanding involving the beautiful but rebellious daughter of local drug kingpin Lando Calrissiano convinced him to move north of the border, where he traded his menacing Luchador mask for a series of dead-end jobs. Inevitably, his lust for violence and danger dragged him back into the seedy, high-stakes world of software development.",

She has been playing around with web dev since high school, she worked on a production-scale web app for the first time as an intern at Systems & Technology Research, and she’ll be an R&D intern at Onshape in the summer of 2015. She’s fascinated by teaching and learning - her research is on assessment in the context of situational motivation in undergraduate STEM courses - and she plays piano and violin in her spare time.",
      "realbio": "‘Sarah Walters’, if she even exists, is one of the finest computer engineers of our generation. Her legend is passed around Silicon Valley like whispers of a ghost: a coder with fiery red hair and a finger in every major project since Google Plus. Her name appears in the source code of thousands of products across the globe, including every last app on the app store. Many impostors have come forward purporting to be this untraceable titan, but none possess the raw skill and lighting reflexes that have become the Walters trademark. Elon Musk has offered a $1,000,000 reward for her capture, or $500,000 for proof of her demise. However, all efforts to track her down, or even definitively prove her existence, have proved fruitless.",

He made his way to Olin from Seattle where his interest in engineering grew from exploring programming and robotics. He began working in the web development space when he joined the eLearning startup LearnBIG in 2013 where he develops a platform for delivering interactive courses. Ben is involved in the curriculum innovation initiative at Olin and is passionate about improving the way engineers are taught especially through peer teaching.",
      "realbio": "Ben Kahle grew up in Beverly Hills, an area often called ‘The Harvard of Hard Knocks’ on account of its reputation for low income and high gang activity. A short stint in county jail at 18 only cemented Ben’s descent into a life of crime, and his sharp mind and disregard for authority has made him a thorn in the side of police forces across the country. Throughout the nineties, many considered Mr. Kahle to be the best safecracker operating west of the Rockies, but a botched bank job in ’01 ended with a dead SWAT team and a life sentence in a Nevada SuperMax. Ben orchestrated a daring breakout just months later, using a sharpened toothbrush and the confusion surrounding a shipment of kale leaves to the prison cafeteria. Ben has been running from the law ever since; if you believe you have seen him, please call the FBI Tipline.",

      "bio": "Evan Dorsky is an Electrical and Computer Engineering major in the Olin class of 2016 from the uneventful suburbs of Avon, CT. Luckily for him, with nothing to do in Avon, Evan started playing with JavaScript on the since-rebranded Freewebs back in 2006. He got his real start with web development at EduCanon in 2013, one year after discovering the joy that is a real text editor. When he’s not developing the web, Evan enjoys spinning fire, playing the violin, and exploring the “Electrical” side of his major (which he will be doing in the summer of 2015 at Apple).",
      "realbio": "A tuba protégé and expert pianist, Evan Brosky is one of the two surviving members of the infamous prog-rock supergroup ‘The Evans’. His meteoric rise to fame was unprecedented in the music industry; rock legend Erwin Schrodinger said of a young Brosky “…a marvelous musician… I think about the only thing the man can’t play is the violin!” After the tragic breakup of ‘The Evans’ and ensuing Canadian civil war, Evan escaped to Nashville and began a promising country music career. However, his continuing inability to master the violin drew him into a darker and darker self-destructive spiral, eventually destroying both his career and his marriage. To feed his growing drug habit, he turned to computer espionage. Some blame him for recent attacks against the Apple computer company; experts cite Brosky’s own struggle with his bent iPhone 6+ as a possible motive.",

He has been programming in JS since the first offering of Olin.js in the spring of 2013. Since then, he has worked on numerous web projects, both personal and for companies. His most significant work with JavaScript came at his most recent job, working on the Tessel embedded development platform at Technical Machine. If he’s not working on something, you can probably find Evan driving across the country commuting between school and work.",
      "realbio": "Standing before the Canadian firing squad and smoking his last cigarette, Evan O’Leary famously remarked, “My only regret is bringing Evan Simpson into the band!” Unlike Brosky, Simpson turned to music much later in life. Evan lied his way into the army at 15, and quickly became an Airborne Ranger. After killing a talented concert cellist during a shootout at the Sydney Opera house, Simpson absorbed the man’s powers and began a world concert tour. At the time, ‘The Evans’ were looking to replace a disgraced Evan Thomson, and Simpson seemed a natural fit. However, his penchant for groupies, as well as his infernal struggle with the trapped soul of the Australian musician, slowly tore the group apart. After an exorcism in 2009, a talentless Simpson was forced into a software development position at MathWorks.",

He has turned down two appointments to the presidency of his native Belgium and killed countless assassins in his single-minded pursuit of this goal.
