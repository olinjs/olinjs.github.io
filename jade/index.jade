			p <span class="drop-cap">Olin.js</span> is a student-led and -developed project-oriented approach to learning modern web application development. With server and client technology advancing so rapidly, the modern website looks very different from that of even a few years ago, and the web will only become a bigger part of our lives in the near future. Olin.js will quickly familiarize students with Node.js as a web server framework and ES5 JavaScript as a responsive client-side language with three weeks of introductory instruction and four weeks of partner labs.

			p Along the way, students will learn the basic layout of the web; how to deploy and maintain large applications; important development strategies, skills, and technologies; and how to design and manage complex, multi-developer software projects. Students will spend the last six weeks of the course putting their knowledge and skills to the test by designing and developing their own web applications.
